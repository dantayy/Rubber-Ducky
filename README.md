# Rubber-Ducky
Rich Media 2 Project 1 (Simple API)

## Goals
- Users can POST code issues on a public board
- posted issues will be saved with a unique id and can be viewed individually by passing that id as a query string in the url
- others can leave comments on posted issues (likely will store as a JSON object of strings within the larger issue JSON object)
- dedicated quack button for each issue (purpose tbd)
